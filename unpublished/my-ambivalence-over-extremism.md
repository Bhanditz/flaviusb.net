This post was prompted by reading Eliezar's 
What do I mean by extremism? Basically, a nonlinear response to certain kinds of stimuli, with an unusually large amount of headroom for escalation, and no internal censors or stop signs for certain kinds of usually forbidden thoughts or actions.

Pros
----

Taking ideas seriously.
- Some of this assumes that you have no compartmentalisation problems/have a sound, complete and consistent set of beliefs; compartmentalisation a la a paraconsistent epistemology can make sense where one knows that ones beliefs taken together can be problematic, but where one cannot jump to any frame that has a smaller kernel of inconsistency...
Doves and Hawks, the random reinforcement schedule, the Shock Doctrine; ideas about social engineering which require extremism.
Getting out of a local maxima requires bridging an energy gap.
Expending ambient energy in periodic burnoffs - 'occasional terrorism' as cheaper[^1] than rare 'total war'.


Cons
----

Unspoken conventions that allow society to function.
Necessity of discontinuous/non-linear response (ie abrupt, unpredictable escalation) makes modelling the outcome of actions more problematic; this leads to decision problems.

Can be summarised as externalities that are not usually considered, as they do not usually need to be considered.

Notes

##Sanction - why some shibboleths are okay.

Assume that ... Take Gx as 'x is good', and Sx as 'x displays the Shibboleth'. First, Sanction comes in a spectrum from weak to strong; weak Sanction meaning roughly that insiders are always preferred over outsiders, and strong Sanction meaning that discourse with outsiders is forbidden[^2]. In this sense, weak Sanction could be justified if conversion is easy or common, and deconversion is rare, and strong Sanction could be justified if conversion is hard or rare, and deconversion is common[^3]? Some kind of Sanction is then appropriate only if both <code>(Gx ≡ Sx) ∨ (P(Gx∣Sx) ≫ P(Gx))</code>, and also one has that only good people produce good ideas, outcomes, or stuff. It seems unlikely that one could prove either of these, let alone both.


[^1]: Both in terms of money, and in terms of lives lost, damaged or disrupted. This seems to be analytically true if one ignores externalities, consequences, etc and considers terrorism to be cheap, politically motivated violence, and war to be expensive, politically motivated violence. Taking externalities and consequences into consideration is 

[^2]: There are stronger Sanctions, such as 'all outsiders are not people', or 'all outsiders must be destroyed'. But, these I could not find any justification for without incredibly tortured or solopsistic reasoning, so I do not consider them here.

[^3]: That is, if many more people may yet be 'saved', use weak Sanction. If everyone who is going to be saved has already been saved, use strong Sanction. This is justified in that weak Sanction allows for more possibility of deconversion or accidental sin, and strong Sanction makes it largely impossible to gain new converts except through breeding.
