My feelings on FLOSSing software that I write
---------------------------------------------

To get this bit out of the way, FLOSSing is a virtuous act etc etc. I hope I don't have to argue for that point; this is not about why to contribute to existing efforts or why people might open things up, but rather about why I open up things that I have made myself.

It is really very simple:

* I care about programmers, rather than users as such. So, unlike rms, I don't GPL things I write out of a feeling of fellowship with all of humanity; I do it out of a feeling of fellowship with all programmers.
* I do not wish to see the progress of humanity halted by selfish or stupid actions of individuals or corporations. That is to say, I want us to have nice things. The code for the commercial Lisp and Smalltalk systems being locked up is one of the reasons we can't have nice things; instead we have Windows (on the bad end) and various Unices (on the best we happen to have, but still not very good end) to choose from.
* Related to the last point, I do not want to see something that was going to be amazing strangled in the crib; opening it up means that if even one programmer wants to keep working on it, they can.

This means that I am very inclined to open up libraries, or things that I don't want to work on anymore but have potential to be big. Basically, stuff mainly for programmers, that just incidentally helps non-programmers.
