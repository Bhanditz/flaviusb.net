Consistency is important to me :
- The tyranny of memory; I think I have performed several memory gambits over my lifetime, and it is easier to cache judgements, and work out what is probably in any given hole in my memory if I am consistent.
- Logic. Just as bayesians think that they have discovered the hidden structure of reality in Bayesian statistics, so I think that I have discovered it in logic. Inconsistent logics explode. The closest one can come is either a paraconsistent logic or some kind of subnormal modal logic. Thus as I am a dualistic and have some ontological and epistemoc commitments already, I view things like ideal ethics and morals and epistemologies to be systems of logic which are perforce consistent.

Consistency in realms of ideology can lead to all sorts of problems, where one can end up believing really stupid stuff in order to avoid a contradiction.
