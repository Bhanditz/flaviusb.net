Drivers vs Identities.
----------------------

- New Zealand's system largely works because each political party has policies and principles which people want because of their different drivers. 
- America's system fails because each party is something that you are a part of, and the policies do not particularly flow from any one set of drivers that 100% of their membership has.

The difference is that in NZ, the parties are really just a shorthand for a collection of likeminded groups, who have a rough agreement on wants and needs, and they can thus meet up and hash out compromises that satisfy enough of each groups distinct drivers, wheras in America it is tribes battling each other, and moreover most of the power has gone to people who benefit from the tribes continuing to battle each other, so that the powerful can do what they like without interference from the populace.
