This post was prompted by running into the same word being used in completly contradictory ways that were central to certain political arguments. Now, I do not live in the US, so at least most people here can have Communism and Socialism explained to them and not explode before you have finished the first sentence, but I do still run into some problems with that. Trying to explain capitalism is worse though. So, first an overall explanation, then some specific examples.

Why Autoantonyms?
-----------------

In English, as in many languages, words can have several distinct, even contradictory meanings. A word that in some sense is its own opposite is an autoantonym; an example pointed out by[supergee](http://supergee.livejournal.com/2645438.html) is 'sanction', which can mean either explicit endorsement or forceful denial. Politics complicates this, with words being deliberately coopted, smeared, or set up as strawmwen, both with and without conscious intention. This promotes equivocation in arguments, which is really quite problematic; even worse, it tends to promote a kind of unconscious equivocation, and the things that give rise to this also make even trying to put this to light quite difficult.

An easy example here: Anarchy.

First, the strawman meaning: violent lawlessness, with men in black masks smashing, burning and mudering with impunity.
Then, the political science meaning, which Anarchists mean when they refer to Anarchism: not needing leaders or coercive social relations; a form of governance comprised of direct action and mutual aid, with the potential addition of direct democracy, personal property (as distinct from private property) and workers collectives amongst other things, and which completely rejects private property, the state, corporations, wage slavery.

Many attempts to reject Anarchism do so through equivocation, where they explicitly reject the strawman version with a reasonable argument, and then implicitly equivocate over the meaning of Anarchism to allow them to reject the actual version as well.

This is complicated further by tribal identification and ingroup-outgroup behaviour; people end up with powerful emotions, and even their identity invested in these definitions. This explains why people react (in the case of mere strong emotions) with seemingly random emotional outbursts, or (in the case of identity) as if it will kill them if they understand or even acknowledge your words, leading to anything from trite thoughtless brushoffs through to paroxysms of rage.

So, Anarchism was easy to talk about because few people have their identity invested in the idea that the strawman version of Anarchism is the true one.
