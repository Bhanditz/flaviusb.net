This post was prompted by trying to untangle my beliefs over property, hierarchy, legitimacy of governance, capital and rent, and function of the state.

Money as sensor
---------------

- Provides a way for people to non-hierarchically work together
- Independant agents...
- Forces information about true preferences in a way that discussion and voting do not necessarily
- Stored work
- Breaking work into bits ie fungibility, liquidity, unit of account, etc

Money as Macguffin
------------------

- I do not want money to be able to do arbitrary things
  - For example, ... buying success rather than buying training

Capital
-------

- Causes 


Hierarchy
---------

- Dynasties bad
- Cleric classes can be good - specialisation, specialist knowledge, useful social roles or social contracts (ie doctor, laywer, confessor)
- In some specific situations hierarchy seems to work exceptionally better than other alternatives ie the military
- The cybernetic problem
  - Problems with getting true information
  - Decisionmakers divorced from the consequences of their decisions
  - Moral hazard
  - Regulatory capture
  - The Principal-Agent problem
- Delayed open vs true open
  - True open is 


Inequality
----------
- 'Natural' inequality due to power laws (ie c^n) and differences in ability, motivation, luck, desire
- 'Bad' inequality
  - Systemic inequality - a part of the violence in the machine
  - Oligarcy and Kleptocracy
