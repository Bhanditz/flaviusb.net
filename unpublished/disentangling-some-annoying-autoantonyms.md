This post was prompted by running into the same word being used in completly contradictory ways that were central to certain political arguments I keep having with people. Now, I do not live in the US, so at least most people here can have 'Communism' and 'Socialism' explained to them and not explode before you have finished the first sentence, but I do still run into some problems with that. Trying to explain what I mean or pin down what other people mean by 'Capitalism' is worse though. So, first an overall explanation, then some specific examples.

Why Autoantonyms?
-----------------

In English, as in many languages, words can have several distinct, even contradictory meanings. A word that in some sense is its own opposite is an autoantonym; an example pointed out by[supergee](http://supergee.livejournal.com/2645438.html) is 'sanction', which can mean either explicit endorsement or forceful denial. Politics complicates this, with words being deliberately coopted, smeared, or set up as strawmwen, both with and without conscious intention. This promotes equivocation in arguments, which is really quite problematic; even worse, it tends to promote a kind of unconscious equivocation, and the things that give rise to this also make even trying to bring this to light in order to be able to actually have a conversation quite difficult.

An easy example here: Anarchy.

First, the strawman meaning: violent lawlessness, with men in black masks smashing, burning and murdering with impunity.

Then, the political science meaning, which Anarchists mean when they refer to Anarchism: not needing leaders or coercive social relations; a form of governance comprised of direct action and mutual aid, with the potential addition of direct democracy, personal property (as distinct from private property) and workers collectives amongst other things, and which completely rejects private property, the state, corporations, wage slavery and potentially various other things.

The typical brushoff argument that those advocating Anarchism receive is: 'So you advocate a system that consists of everyone just wearing black masks and smashing things, eh? Well, that is bad, and also how would we have roads and food if people just wear black masks and smash things? Therefore you are wrong, and Anarchism is bad.'

This is a really obvious, contrived version of the argument, to illustrate rejection of an ideology through equivocation, where the speaker explicitly rejects the strawman version of the ideology (here Anarchism) with a reasonable argument, and then implicitly equivocates over the meaning of the word used to identify the ideology in question to allow them to reject the actual version as well. One would think that stopping this would be as simple as saying:

"Hang on now, Anarchism is a word that has several meanings, and the meaning that I refer to in my advocacy is the political science meaning, which is ..."

Unfortunately, it isn't.

This is complicated further by tribal identification and ingroup-outgroup behaviour; people end up with powerful emotions, and even their identity invested in these definitions. This explains why people react (in the case of mere strong emotions) with seemingly random emotional outbursts, or (in the case of identity) as if it will kill them if they understand or even acknowledge your words, leading to anything from trite thoughtless brushoffs through to paroxysms of rage.

So, Anarchism was comparatively easy to talk about because few people have their identity invested in the idea that the strawman version of Anarchism is the true one, but there often is still some difficulty, caused by spillover from people having identity tied up in some other system (such as Capitalism) being The Only Right Answer, and therefore some identity tied up in there not being any reasonable alternatives.


Capitalism

vs Mercantilism
a naive 'Marketism'
creative destruction
a way of organising independent
