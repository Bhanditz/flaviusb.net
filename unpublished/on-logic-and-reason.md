###Motivation
This particular rant is aimed at Objectivists who throw around the words 'Logic' and 'Reason' as cornerstones of their philosophy.

- Logic as a symbol manipulation game
- There are various systems of logic, which are all formal axiomatic systems
- Some parts of reality are described using logical models, but some amount of work must always be done to bridge the two. For example, logic can be used to analyse geometry, but there must be a bridge. Geometry can additionally be used to talk about the physical world, but again, a bridge must be used.
- Difference between a Formal Science and an Empirical Science
- Metamathematics

- Reason as merely Instrumental
- Cognitive Science
  - Empirical research into how our minds actually work
- The 'Faculty of Reason'
- Philosophy of Science

- Analytic philosophy
- 'Grammaticism': the idea that some things are true because of grammar or can be derived as analytic truths *in the actually existing universe* from the way that sentences are constructed.
    Refutations:
      - Explicating the equivocation: for example, 'A=A', the 'foundation' of Objectivism. It is 'proved' by treating it as a tautology, but then used to mean things that are not tautological, and not subject to the proof that was given.
      - Natural languages with a 0th person
      - Conlangs
      - All the work that Kant had to do to get things like the Categorical Imperative to work; it isn't trivial, and you end up with something quite different from naive grammaticism.
